# exaSIMPLE
Repository to be used for the exaSIMPLE project

Meeting - 19/03/2024
People present: Artur Lidtke (MARIN); Jo√£o Muralha (blueOASIS)
Topic: Initial talks about SIMPLE prototype

Brainstorming:
- Possible use of FiPY (JM) (https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/index.html)
- Adaptation of Artur OpenFOAM tutorials (https://github.com/UnnamedMoose/BasicOpenFOAMProgrammingTutorials/blob/master/OFtutorial14_SIMPLE_algorithm/OFtutorial14.C) to python:
    1 - Start it simple only equally cartesian grids (simplifies interpolations)
    2 - Increase complexity of interpolations and adaptations to handle more complex grids
- Possible start Python script that only receives the matrices from OpenFOAM or ReFRESCO and solves them 

Extrating matrices from ReFRESCO to python: Artur can easily do that and has it set-up

Artur also run some ML examples that can be used by Mariana as examples and possible test cases.

TODO:
- Create github repository (JM)
- Add already available ML data (AL) and ReFRESCO matrices to start ML work
